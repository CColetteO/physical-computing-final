## Project:  < Name of your Project / Device Goes here >

The <title> is a tea dispenser to help those who enjoy looseleaf tea save time in the morning. It can hold up to seven types of tea, and provides easy measurement for tea by the pot or by the cup. 

### Detailed Project Description

The <title> has three main parts: the rotating holder, the funnel, and the removable single-cup dispenser. 

The rotating holder has seven slots. The intent is to have a week's worth of tea, but they can be used in any order so it can also be used for seven different types to be used and refilled as desired. It can be rotated using buttons on the device or via the accompanying website. There is an eighth spot, which does not hold tea, which it should be set to when not in use to minimize air exposure and potential disruption to the teas. Once the desired slot is selected, one can refill it and optionally* set it as filled, or have it dispense the tea into the funnel. 

The funnel is in place to make use much easier. Since the openings from the slots are so wide, so as to allow the tea to be poured in, it is difficult to place anything to catch all of the tea that pours out. The funnel catches the outflow from the holder and narrows it. It can then flow directly into the infuser of a teapot, or into the included removable single-cup dispenser. 

The dispenser allows the user to have single-cup servings rather than making a whole pot at once, without the need for separate measuring devices. Simply place the infuser or reusable K-cup onto the bed, then turn the handle and it will dispense the amount appropriate for one cup of tea! (Note: This does not work smoothly for tea with large pieces, due to the rotating parts, so it is recommended that this piece only be used for teas without chunks.) 

Together, these increase convenience while cutting down on the environmental impact of frequent tea making. It can save storage space, by allowing seven different types of tea to be stored in one container without mixing, or it can save time on busy mornings by allowing the user to select and pour out the tea in advance, similar to how many adults will mete out their medications for the week all at once. It is also extremely convenient in that it saves measuring; the slots all hold just over one pot of tea, and the dispenser measures one cup's worth for you, so you simply pour in enough to almost fill the slot and there is no need for teaspoons or other measuring devices! Furthermore, by using looseleaf and reusable K-cups or infusers, this cuts down significantly on the garbage usually caused by making tea. Rather than a K-cup, which includes plastic that does not degrade well, or a teabag that will often come with a tag, a staple, and a foil wrapper in addition to the bag itself, these reusable pieces can just be rinsed off and reused. 


*To accomodate users who would rather keep track of which teas are empty or full on their own, and to avoid frustration in case of a power failure resetting filled/empty settings, having the slot set as empty will NOT prevent the tea from dispensing. It will function normally. The filled/empty information is intended to allow those dispsensing remotely to know which teas are available.
